## Overview

While Vite already offers a very easy setup when compared to something like Webpack there is some configuration needed especially if you would like to use ESLint. This project aims to provide a fast and easy way to get going on your next project. The project uses a un-opinionated ESLint setting to aid development and Prettier for formatting.

If you are looking for a template that includes TailwindCSS and its Prettier plugin, I have you covered right [here](https://github.com/Tribalash/create-react-vite-tailwind).

## Setup & Configuration

No configuration or setup is neccisary, however, if you would like to change the default Prettier formatting rules you can in .prettierrc.

## Scripts

To launch the project with the dev. server run:

```npm run dev```

To create a production build run:

```npm run build"```

To preview your build before production run:

```npm run preview```

To get a list of any ESLint warnings and Errors run:

```npm run lint```

after running this script and having errors you can run the following to walk you through the issues in more detail:

```npm run lint -- --debug```

To format the project with prettier run:

```npm run format```
