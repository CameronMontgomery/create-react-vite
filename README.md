# React & Vite Setup

## Overview

While Vite already offers a very easy setup when compared to something like Webpack there is some configuration needed especially if you would like to use ESLint.

## Scripts

To launch the project with the dev. server run:
```npm run dev```

To create a production build run:
```npm run build"```

To preview your build before production run:
```npm run preview```

To get a list of any ESLint warnings and Errors run:
```npm run lint```

after running this script and having errors you could run:
```npm run lint -- --debug```

This will walk you through the issues in more detail.

To format the project with prettier run:
```npm run format```
